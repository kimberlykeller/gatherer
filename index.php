		<h1>Database Design Project for Gatherer</h1>
		<h3>Persona</h3>
		<p>Aleck is 25 years old with a degree in Electrical Engineering. He enjoys tabletop gaming and problem solving.
		In his spare time he builds or fixes small things by hand in his garage workshop, inlcudes things like woodworking
		or bike repair. He is detail oriented, focused, and introverted, but enjoys small doses of social situations, such as <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>
		tournaments or playing with his friends casually. He has a handful of interests that he dives deeply into, such as sci-fi and fantasy,
		craft beer, etc.
		He is technology and internet savvy. He will primarily access Gatherer through a desktop or laptop
		with a high speed internet connection. He may have built his own desktop tower and owns his modem and router.
		He is desperately waiting for Google Fiber so that he can break up with Comcast, because he knows that Comcast is evil.

		Other gaming interests include: Settlers of Catan, Sentinels of the Multiverse, Chez Geek, Call of Cthulhu, Arkham Horror.
