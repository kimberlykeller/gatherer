		<h3>Conceptual Model</h3>
		<p>A card can be in many expansions but each expansion will only have one version of that card. Each expansion will have
		many cards. A card can have many comments but that card can only have one of that commment. Many users can comment on many cards.
		Many users can rate many cards but a card can only have one rating. </p>
